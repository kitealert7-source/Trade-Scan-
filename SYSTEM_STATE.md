## Known Issues
### Auto-detected (regenerated each run)
- **Post-merge watch CLOSED_OK:** 5/5 runs clean (commit 1b6cc7b). Run `python tools/post_merge_watch.py --archive` to clear.

### Manual (deferred TDs, operational context)
<!-- Add tech-debt items, deferred work, and operational caveats here. Auto-detected entries above regenerate on each run; entries here persist. -->

- **Broader-pytest failures outside gate suite (3 pre-existing):**
  - `tests/test_state_paths_worktree.py` ×2 — pre-existing from 2026-05-11.
  - `tests/test_indicator_semantic_contracts.py::test_referenced_indicators_declare_signal_primitive` — pre-existing; 4 new indicator primitives missing from the Classifier Gate `_ALLOWED_PRIMITIVES` allowlist. Separate concern from the Stage-0.5 allowlist landed today.
  Note: the 2 `test_registry_integrity` failures from earlier today's close were closed by commit `7388453` (22-stub metadata backfill).
- ~~Manual-section persistence caveat~~ — **closed by commit `670bf02`** (`tools/system_introspection.py` now preserves the Manual section across regen verbatim; tests pinned in `tests/test_system_state_manual_persist.py`). This entry's own survival across the next regen is the validation proof.
