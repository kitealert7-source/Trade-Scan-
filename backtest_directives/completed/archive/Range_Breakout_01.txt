Notes:

Core Logic: Range Breakout

Entry Rules:

• Range Definition Window:
  Analyze price action between 03:00 and 06:00 UTC.
  Use M15 data to compute:
      - Highest High
      - Lowest Low
  This defines the session range.

• Volatility Filter (ATR Percentile Regime Filter):
  Compute ATR(14) on M15 timeframe.
  Calculate rolling ATR percentile over the past 100 completed M15 bars.
  Trade is permitted ONLY if:
      ATR Percentile > 66%

  If ATR Percentile ≤ 66%, skip trading for that session.

• Order Placement (at 06:00 UTC, only if filter passes):
  Place:
      - Buy Stop at Session High
      - Sell Stop at Session Low

• Execution Logic:

  1. At 06:00 UTC:
     - Place both Buy Stop (Session High) and Sell Stop (Session Low).

  2. When one order triggers:
     - Immediately cancel the opposite pending order.
     - Apply Stop Loss at opposite side of session range.

  3. If the first trade closes (either by Stop Loss or at 18:00 time exit):
     - If total executed trades for the session < 2:
         Re-place both Buy Stop and Sell Stop at the original session range levels.
     - Otherwise:
         Do not place any further orders.

  4. Maximum 2 total executed trades per session.
     Trades may occur in any direction (Long + Long, Short + Short, or Long + Short).
     No third trade is permitted.


Exit Rules:

• Time-Based Exit:
  Close all open positions at 18:00 UTC.

• Stop Loss:
  Opposite side of the defined session range.
