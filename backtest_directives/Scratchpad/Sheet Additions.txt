Why This Is a Good Idea

As your sheet grows:

You accumulate independent signal expressions.

Some will dominate in certain regimes.

Some will be capital-efficient but noisy.

Some will be stable but low power.

Instead of picking “one winner,”
you build a strategy basket.

That’s institutional thinking.

2️⃣ The Danger of Using Only Sharpe + Expectancy

Sharpe measures:

Return per unit volatility.

Expectancy measures:

Average profit per trade.

Neither measures:

Correlation between strategies

Concurrency overlap

Drawdown synchronization

Regime overlap

If you pick top 5 by Sharpe,
they may all be:

US-mean-reversion variants

Firing in the same volatility bucket

Losing together

That’s not diversification.

That’s duplication.

3️⃣ The Correct Way to Use the Sheet

Your sheet is useful as a first filter, not final selection.

Step 1 — Quality Filter

Remove strategies with:

Sharpe < 0.8

Expectancy near 0

Profit factor < 1.2

Return/DD < 1.5

This trims weak engines.

Step 2 — Correlation Filter

Compute correlation between strategy equity curves.

Only include strategies where:

Average pairwise correlation < 0.6
Prefer < 0.4

This is critical.

Step 3 — Concurrency Overlap Check

Two strategies may:

Have low equity correlation

But fire trades simultaneously

That increases portfolio stress.

You need concurrency overlap metric across strategies.

Step 4 — Regime Complementarity

If all strategies:

Lose in high volatility regime

Then your basket collapses in stress.

You want:

Some that thrive in high vol
Some that thrive in low vol

4️⃣ Expectancy vs Sharpe — Which Matters More?

For portfolio construction:

Sharpe > Expectancy.

Because expectancy ignores volatility clustering.

But:

Return/DD is even more important for strategy baskets.

High Sharpe with huge tail drawdown is fragile.

5️⃣ What You’re Really Building

You’re evolving from:

Single strategy research
→ Strategy portfolio architecture

This is a different discipline.

You now need:

Strategy-level capital allocation

Strategy correlation matrix

Strategy concurrency matrix

Strategy regime exposure profile

6️⃣ What Your Sheet Should Eventually Contain

Each strategy row should include:

CAGR

Sharpe

MAR

Return/DD

Max DD duration

Avg concurrency

p95 concurrency

Avg correlation vs others

Regime PnL breakdown

Stress removal resilience

Then you rank by:

Utility-adjusted score, not raw Sharpe.

7️⃣ Brutal Reality

If you use only Sharpe + Expectancy:

You will over-allocate to:

US-heavy mean reversion variants

Highly similar systems

Your basket will look diversified but collapse together.

8️⃣ The Right Way to Grow This

As sheet grows:

Build strategy-level correlation matrix.

Run strategy stress removal test (remove top strategy).

Run strategy cluster removal (remove US-style strategies).

Optimize basket size for MAR, not CAGR.

9️⃣ Strategic Insight

Your edge is not “best strategy.”

Your edge becomes:

Portfolio of independent edges.

That’s where compounding power emerges.

Final Answer

Yes — you can build a basket from the sheet.

But:

Do not rank by Sharpe alone.
Do not rank by expectancy alone.

Use:

Sharpe filter
Correlation filter
Concurrency filter
Regime diversification filter

Then allocate capital proportionally.
