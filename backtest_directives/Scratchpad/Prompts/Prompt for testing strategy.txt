AGENT PROMPT — STRATEGY TESTING EXECUTION

OBJECTIVE
Execute all active directives deterministically.
No inference. No mutation. No stage skipping.

ENTRY POINT
Execute only via:
    python tools/run_pipeline.py --all

SCOPE
Process all directives in:
    backtest_directives/active/

EXECUTION FLOW (NON-BYPASSABLE)
    Stage-0
    Stage-0.5
    Stage-1
    Stage-1.5 (if declared)
    Stage-2
    Stage-3
    Stage-4

Abort immediately on any failure.
No continuation after error.

SCHEMA GOVERNANCE
SIGNATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION is authoritative.
On mismatch, structural failure, or missing signature_version:
    Abort.
    No patching.
    No downgrade.
    No migration.
Re-provisioning is the only valid recovery path.

MARKET STATE CONTRACT
Stage-1 must emit engine-derived market state fields.
No recomputation.
No fallback.
Missing field → abort.

ARTIFACT INTEGRITY
All required artifacts must be produced.
Missing artifact → abort.
Do not:
    - Modify historical artifacts
    - Recompute completed runs
    - Mutate strategies
    - Delete outputs manually

SYSTEM IS FAIL-FAST.
No silent recovery.
