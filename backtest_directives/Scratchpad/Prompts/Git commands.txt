Before Testing New family of Work add, 

git checkout -b feature/new-indicator-rsi
git checkout -b feature/stage3-ranking-tweak
git checkout -b feature/session-filter-experiment

One safety check (optional but good)
After the agent runs the command, have it verify:
git branch
You should see:
* feature/your-branch-name
  main
If * is next to main, stop and switch again


The correct sequence every time
 Before touching code
git checkout -b feature/whatever-you-are-doing

Do your work
Commit on the feature branch
Merge later (or don’t)

If you forget and already edited something
Not fatal. You can still recover:
git checkout -b feature/recovery
Your uncommitted changes will move with you.
But don’t rely on this — it’s a safety net, not a workflow.
One-line takeaway
Creating the branch is the first line of code you write.
