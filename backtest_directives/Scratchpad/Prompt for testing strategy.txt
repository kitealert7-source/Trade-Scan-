MASTER EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

(Generic — Applicable to All Strategies)

AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Operate strictly under:

TRADE_SCAN_DOCTRINE
SOP_TESTING
SOP_OUTPUT
Trade_Scan Preflight Agent Specification
SOP_OUTPUT_AGENT_SUMMARY
SOP_AGENT_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE
STRATEGY_PLUGIN_CONTRACT
trade_scan_invariants_state_gated

Trade_Scan is the ONLY permitted execution engine.
Universal_Research_Engine must be used exactly as declared.
Directive text is the sole source of strategy logic.
No interpretation. No enhancement. No substitution.

SCOPE

Execute all directives present in:

Trade_Scan/backtest_directives/active

Sequentially.
Batch mode only.
Determinism prioritized over speed.

PIPELINE

Preflight → Stage-1 Execution → Stage-2 Compilation → Stage-3 Aggregation → Stage-4 Portfolio Evaluation

No stage skipping permitted.

PREFLIGHT (MANDATORY)

Invoke Trade_Scan Preflight Agent.

Proceed ONLY if:
result == ALLOW_EXECUTION

Else:
ABORT immediately.

STRATEGY LOAD

Load directive exclusively from:

Trade_Scan/backtest_directives/active/<DIRECTIVE_NAME>

No alternative source permitted.

STAGE-1 — EXECUTION

Requirements:

Clean isolated state

Directive-declared historical scope only

Default sizing unless explicitly overridden

No external inference

No data substitution

On success:

set run_status = RUN_COMPLETE

move directive → completed_run/

On failure:

emit NO artifacts

leave directive in active/

STOP

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS (HARD REQUIREMENT)

results_tradelevel.csv
results_standard.csv
results_risk.csv
results_yearwise.csv
metrics_glossary.csv
run_metadata.json

Missing any artifact → HARD FAILURE.

STAGE-2 — COMPILATION

Consume Stage-1 artifacts only.
No recomputation of authoritative values.
No signal re-evaluation.
Failure → ABORT.

STAGE-3 — AGGREGATION

Permitted ONLY if:
run_status == RUN_COMPLETE

Aggregate mechanically from Stage-2 artifacts.
No qualitative adjustments.
No metric reinterpretation.

STAGE-4 — PORTFOLIO EVALUATION

Run Portfolio Evaluator.

Permitted ONLY if:
run_status == RUN_COMPLETE

Portfolio evaluation must:

Use closed-trade equity model

Preserve deterministic thresholds

Produce immutable snapshot

Emit summary + stress report

No governance overrides permitted.

HARD ABORT CONDITIONS

Abort immediately if:

Preflight ≠ ALLOW_EXECUTION

run_status ≠ RUN_COMPLETE

any required artifact missing

any stage requires inference

any stage mutates prior stage outputs

COMPLETION OUTPUT

Return ONLY:

execution status

artifact file paths

summary of quantitative results

improvement suggestions strictly aligned with TRADE_SCAN_DOCTRINE

No commentary.
No qualitative narrative.
No speculative reasoning.

STOP.
