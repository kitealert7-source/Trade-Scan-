# Trade_Scan

Trade_Scan is a read-only consumer of research-grade data.

- It supports human-directed research only
- It includes capital and broker-cost simulation for validation
- It has no execution, no live trading, and no automation authority
- Nothing is immutable unless explicitly frozen by humans
