AGENT PROMPT — STANDARD CLEANUP RUN

Context:

Strategy_Master_Filter.xlsx is the sole authoritative source of truth.

The filesystem must be reconciled to the current state of the Master Sheet.

Do not assume which strategies or runs were modified.

Task:

Run cleanup reconciler in dry-run mode:

python tools/cleanup_reconciler.py


Validate that:

Every planned deletion targets artifacts not represented in the Master Sheet.

No artifact still represented in the Master Sheet is scheduled for deletion.

Action ordering is deterministic.

If and only if dry-run output is correct, run cleanup in execute mode:

python tools/cleanup_reconciler.py --execute


After execution:

Verify all planned deletions were applied.

Verify preserved artifacts remain untouched.

Verify Master Sheet reflects the authoritative post-cleanup state.

Re-run cleanup:

python tools/cleanup_reconciler.py


Expect no output (idempotence check).

Reporting:

Report PASS if the final dry-run produces no actions.

Report FAIL with the first unexpected action only.

Rules:

Do not infer intent beyond the Master Sheet.

Do not manually delete files.

Do not add heuristics or extra cleanup.

Treat any file locks or failures as non-fatal; allow the next run to converge.
