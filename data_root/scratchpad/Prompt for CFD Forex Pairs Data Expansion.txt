Agent Mandate — Forex CFD Expansion (Architecturally Constrained)
Objective (Non-Negotiable)

Expand Anti-Gravity data coverage by adding the following OctaFX Forex CFD assets:

EURJPY

GBPJPY

CHFJPY

AUDJPY

NZDJPY

CADJPY

EURGBP

Across native OctaFX timeframes:

1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d

All work must remain:

SOP v17 compliant

Append-only

Deterministic

Zero resampling

Zero architectural reinterpretation

🔒 Implementation Constraint (Critical)

The agent must:

Extend the existing FX symbol registry only.

NOT create new ingestion functions.

NOT duplicate FX ingestion logic.

NOT alter timeframe dictionaries.

NOT modify execution semantics logic.

New symbols must inherit the existing OctaFX ingestion pipeline.

Historical Bootstrap Rule

For each new asset–timeframe pair:

Ingest full available broker history.

If broker history is limited, that limit is authoritative.

Do NOT fabricate or infer earlier history.

Lifecycle Enforcement

After RAW ingestion:

Run validator (must PASS, no bypass).

Rebuild CLEAN.

Rebuild RESEARCH.

Register lineage.

Leave all pre-existing datasets unchanged.

Explicit Prohibitions

❌ No new assets beyond list
❌ No new timeframes
❌ No resampling
❌ No derived bars
❌ No symbol-specific ingestion forks
❌ No validator relaxation
❌ No heuristic gap filling

Output Required

Broker symbol names used (exact MT5 identifiers)

Years covered per asset per timeframe

RAW file count created

CLEAN file count created

RESEARCH file count created

Validator PASS confirmation

Final datasets_validated value

No commentary. No redesign.
