Agent Mandate — FX + Daily Data Expansion (AG v17)
Objective (Non-Negotiable)

Expand AG data coverage by adding FX pairs (OctaFX) and Daily timeframe data in a way that is:

SOP-v17 compliant

Append-only

Deterministic

Zero resampling

Zero architectural reinterpretation

Agent must not introduce new contracts, rules, or opinions.

Scope of Assets (Exact — do not extend)

FX (OctaFX):

EURUSD

GBPUSD

USDJPY

USDCHF

AUDUSD

NZDUSD

USDCAD

All FX datasets in AG v17 are sourced from OctaFX. No alternative FX feeds are currently active.

Existing assets (already present):

XAUUSD (Gold)

BTC

ETH

Scope of Timeframes

For ALL above assets, ingest native feed data only for:

1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d


Constraints:

❌ No resampling

❌ No derived bars

❌ No inferred timeframes

❌ Reject unsupported feed–timeframe pairs

Validator enforcement must remain intact per SOP_DATA_TIMEFRAMES_v1.

Data Lifecycle Rules (Must Follow Exactly)

Agent must comply with:

ANTI_GRAVITY_DATA_LIFECYCLE_SOP_v17

DATA_UPDATE_RUNBOOK_v17

DATASET_GOVERNANCE_SOP_v17-DV1

SOP_DATA_TIMEFRAMES_v1

Key invariants:

RAW is append-only, per-year

CLEAN & RESEARCH rebuilt after RAW update

No overwrite, no backfill, no mutation

Canonical filenames only:

[ASSET]_[FEED]_[TIMEFRAME]_[YEAR]_[RAW|CLEAN|RESEARCH].csv

What the Agent MUST Do

Extend ingestion configuration to include:

the 7 FX pairs

daily timeframe (1d) where supported

Run incremental RAW ingestion

Per SOP17 incremental protocol

Update RAW manifests and logs

Run validator

Must pass without warnings or soft bypasses

Rebuild CLEAN and RESEARCH

Dataset versions start at RESEARCH_v1_* for new datasets

Existing datasets must remain unchanged

Produce a completion report

Assets × Timeframes ingested

Files created (counts)

Validation status

Any rejected feed–timeframe pairs (if applicable)

Explicit Prohibitions (Critical)

The agent must NOT:

❌ Add a “daily contract”

❌ Change or reinterpret regime logic

❌ Introduce execution assumptions

❌ Modify existing datasets

❌ Add extra assets “for completeness”

❌ Relax validator rules

❌ Use daily OHLC in strategy logic

This task is data plumbing only.

Output Expected from Agent

Successful ingestion + rebuild

Validator PASS
