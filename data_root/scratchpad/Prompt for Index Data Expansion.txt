Agent Mandate — Index CFD + Daily Data Expansion (AG v17)

Objective (Non-Negotiable)

Expand Anti-Gravity data coverage by adding Index CFD datasets (OctaFX, Daily)
in a manner that is:

- SOP v17 compliant
- Append-only
- Deterministic
- Zero resampling
- Zero architectural reinterpretation

The agent must not introduce new contracts, rules, or opinions.

---

Scope of Assets (Exact — do not extend)

Index CFDs (OctaFX):

- SPX500
- NAS100
- GER40
- AUS200
- UK100
- FRA40
- ESP35
- EUSTX50
- US30
- JPN225

All index datasets are sourced from OctaFX only.
No alternative index feeds are permitted.

---

Scope of Timeframes

For ALL above indices, ingest native feed data only for:

- 1d (Daily)

---

Constraints (Strict)

❌ No resampling  
❌ No derived bars  
❌ No inferred timeframes  
❌ Reject unsupported feed–timeframe pairs  
❌ No partial history

Validator enforcement must remain intact per SOP_DATA_TIMEFRAMES_v1.

---

Data Lifecycle Rules (Must Follow Exactly)

Agent must comply with:

- ANTI_GRAVITY_SOP_v17
- DATA_UPDATE_RUNBOOK_v17
- DATASET_GOVERNANCE_SOP_v17-DV1
- SOP_DATA_TIMEFRAMES_v1

Key invariants:

- RAW is append-only, per-year
- CLEAN and RESEARCH rebuilt after RAW ingestion
- No overwrite, no mutation, no silent backfill
- Canonical filenames only:

  [ASSET]_[FEED]_[TIMEFRAME]_[YEAR]_[RAW|CLEAN|RESEARCH].csv

---

What the Agent MUST Do

1. Verify MASTER_DATA authorization exists for all listed indices.
2. Perform historical RAW ingestion for Daily timeframe (full available history).
3. Run validator — must PASS with no bypasses.
4. Rebuild CLEAN datasets.
5. Rebuild RESEARCH datasets (execution prices embedded per OctaFX rules).
6. Ensure dataset_version is correctly initialized for new datasets.
7. Leave all existing datasets unchanged.

---

Explicit Prohibitions (Critical)

The agent must NOT:

❌ Add new assets beyond the list  
❌ Add new timeframes  
❌ Modify execution models  
❌ Modify existing datasets  
❌ Relax validator rules  
❌ Introduce strategy logic  
❌ “Fill gaps” heuristically  

This task is data plumbing only.

---

Output Expected from Agent

- Validator PASS
- Assets ingested
- Years covered per asset
- Files created (RAW / CLEAN / RESEARCH counts)
- Any rejected asset–timeframe pairs (if applicable)

No commentary. No design suggestions.
