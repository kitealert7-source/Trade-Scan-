Entry Rules

Identify the highest high and lowest low during this 3-hour window using M5 data.
Orders are placed immediately after range finalization.
Order Placement (06:00 UTC)
Place Buy Stop at the session high.
Place Sell Stop at the session low.

    ◦ A Buy Stop order at the highest point of the range.
    ◦ A Sell Stop order at the lowest point of the range.

• Execution Logic: The strategy waits for one of the orders to be triggered. As soon as one order is executed, the opposing pending order is immediately deleted.
• Frequency: Maximum two trades per day (if first trade hits SL and opposite side later triggers).No re-entry after second trade.

• Time-Based Exit: All open positions are closed in the evening at 18:00 UTC.
• Stop loss is placed at the opposite side of the defined range.
• Take Profit: There is no Take Profit (TP) target used. The strategy relies on the time-based exit or the stop loss.
• Trailing Stop: None.
